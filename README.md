# SG-Bus-Tracking
## Overview
Tracking Buses in Singapore depends on a user's GPS and at times usually inaccurate in Singapore. Through using the arrival timings, buses can be estimated and tracked

## Outcome
The idea behind this project is to achieve the following objectives

### SBS Bus
 - Tracking of bus
 - Notifying user of end bus stop
 - Mixture with Google Maps to search Start and Destination to route 

### NTU Bus
 - Tracking of NTU Buses
 - Identify buses that are off the grid and fix them
 - Example: Blue bus identified as Rider on application

## Things to Do

### SBS Bus
 - Track all SBS buses in operation at a particular time
 - Fix bugs that may occur when 2 buses are consecutively travelling together
 - Creating a webapp to select bus stop and alert you when the bus is nearing the stop
 - 2 Bus stop ID
 - Start tracking from 1 till the end
 - Choose your own route. Preplan your route with the buses you are taking and the app will allocate the respective apps to check the timing and save as a route. e.g. Bishan to Ang Mo Kio
- Buses and MRT Timings involved
 
### NTU Bus
 - Identify Bus Patterns
 - Have a 24 hr map of how buses operate
